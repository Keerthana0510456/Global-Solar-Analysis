Global Solar Analysis

1. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global solar energy trends using real-time data. The analysis looks into key metrics such as solar radiation, energy production, and installed capacity across different regions. A Power BI dashboard is used to visualize insights, helping to understand how solar energy is utilized globally.

2. Files in This Project
- solar_data.csv: This dataset contains real-time global solar energy data, including key metrics like solar radiation, energy production, and installed capacity.
- global_solar_analysis.pbix: The Power BI dashboard file which contains visualizations and insights derived from the real-time data.

3. How to Open the Dashboard
To explore the Power BI dashboard:
 - Download the repository to your computer.
 - Install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) if you donâ€™t already have it.
 - Open the solar.pbix file in Power BI Desktop and interact with the dashboard to explore insights.

4. Future Improvements
In the future, I plan to:
- Expand the Analysis: Include more regions and countries in the dataset to get a broader view of global solar energy usage.
- Advanced Insights: Integrate predictive analytics to forecast future solar energy trends based on historical data.
